# Bicycle Example
This project intends to demonstrate OOP concepts in Symfony and asserting those behaviors through tests in PHPUnit. Inside the `src/Entity` folder you will find different classes representing parts of a `Bicycle` as well as a Motorcycle being an Extension of the `Bicycle` class.

### Clone the Symfony repo to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard.git```
### Install the Composer dependencies:
```composer install```

### Assert the objects behave as expected using PHP unit
```php bin/phpunit```
